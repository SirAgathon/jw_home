## Background

It has been a week or so since Salesforce announced its likely acquisition of Slack for 27.7 billion dollars -- becoming its largest deal to date. Many have criticized CEO Mark Benioff's decision, citing that the acquisition overvalues Slack.[^1] As a result, Salesforce stock prices have declined while Slack's has increased to $45 to match the valuation. As for me, I stand by Mark's decision. I sold my shares of Slack to reinvest into Salesforce. And, here's why.

## Network Effects

I came across the fascinating concept of network effects today while reading up on research literature. In a nutshell, network effects refer to the dynamic system of operational components such as pricing, quality, and demand that scale with an increasing user base. Take a basic rendition of Uber's network effect, for instance.

The bandwagon effect occurs when an entity becomes most dominant in the network. And, this confers exponential growth and monopoly-like benefits.

## Conclusion

Salesforce's valuation of Slack is primarily hinged upon its network. And, I believe the main component which elicits this high valuation of Slack is its horizontal reach.

What I am referring to, in other words, is its capacity for integrating and connecting a wide array of companies and entities on its platform -- like a social network primarily for companies, if you may. Microsoft Teams, on the other hand, has a limited capacity in this regard, having been built vertically or specialized for internal communications. Driving home my point, this is why hackathons and universities use Slack. And so, I leave you, my dear reader, with the billion-dollar question: just how much more exposure does Slack have compared to Microsoft Teams? 

My guess would be at least 27.7 billions of dollars worth.
