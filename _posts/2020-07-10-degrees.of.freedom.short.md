> Each passing moment is laden with a decision. A majority of moments are characterized by a decision of inaction whereas a few seem to matter very much -- in hindsight. I intend to say this with 
  skepticism because, in full consideration, all moments and their decisions are critical. Having paved the bed of soil, I, now, plant this seed of wisdom: with every passing moment and decision, consciously or unconsciously made, I find that I lose some degree of freedom. No, I do not consider this a spawn of evil. Unlike one who wishes to bury a deep, dark secret -- hopefully, casting it away forever, I surround this seed with infinite tenderness. This seed is my shrine, and I honor it so that, one day -- in the not too distant future, it shall bear sweet, refreshing fruit for me and my companions along the journey of life.
